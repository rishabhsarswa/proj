Theory :

	Normally domestic wiring used in houses, small commercial areas etc. 
	Domestic supply is available on  230 to 240 volts and 15 amperes. 
	Normally when construct the domestic wiring houses then the supply is taken from energy metre. 
	Because supply is available on metre fan and distribution poles and the supply is distributing 
	all over the appliances from metre by through distribution board is a device that directs 
	electricity from one or more source.it is an assembly of one or more panels each of which 
	contain switches that allows electricity to be directed.
	
	Normal distribution on board for switch board contains indicators ,switches etc. 
	Some lines on the switch board we show a protection fuse. Indicators show that the line 
	continuously and socket is useful to connect external appliances which uses  plug. 
	There are few types of socket 2 pin 2A socket and 2 pin 5A socket.
	
	3 pin 5A, 3 pin 15A, 6 pin 25A and more extensive rating of sockets available in the market. 
	Sockets are made up of bakelite and procline. Switch board also contains switches 
	which is used for making circuit or not. 
	Mostly switches are available in to a 5A, 10A ,15A and 25A rating. 
	In switches internally screw and strips nut and bolts are made by brass and similarly in socket. 
	Internal connection made on brass Bolt.
	
	When we construct domestic wiring we must follow the rules that are face is most taken as red 
	wire similarly neutral wire is black in colour and Earth wire is green in colour. 
	In socket Earth wire is more thicker than phase and neutral wire because it contains low resistance path.

	<img src="exp1p1.jpg" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">	
	
Procedure : 
	
	For making domestic wiring for one switch board phase wire is connect with common copper wire for all 
	the switches any type phase is available on the terminal of switch and the second wire is taken from 
	the upper terminal of switch and it is direct connect with the appliances as phase wire outlet wire of 
	appliances is called neutral. It is the black wire that is neutral wire of the appliances is common. 
	neutral wire projector at the indicators neutral terminal all terminal must be connect with the earth 
	wire and Earth wire must be connected at a thing domestic wiring with on switch board is shown in figure.

Experiment : 2

Object : To study the construction working principle of the desert cooler of traditional cooler.

Apparatus Required :
	
	S No.	Apparatus Name		Rating		Quantity	

	1	Desert cooler				1
	2	Test lamp		40 watt		1
	3	Screw driver				1
	4	Power supply 		230V/50Hz 	--	
		
Theory :

	Desert Cooler 
	
		Desert coolers are based on the simple principle that when unsaturated air comes in contact with water, 
		the water evaporates. In the process, the moisture content of air increases, 
		while its temperature decreases. The resulting cold but moist air is used for providing cooling. 
		Thus a desert cooler is a simple device, which consists of an arrangement for blowing dry 
		and hot air over a wet surface and an arrangement for keeping the surface wet continuously. 
		The cooler normally consists of a blower and a pump. Desert coolers are economical 
		(both initial and running costs are low) and are effective in hot and dry areas. 
		They are not effective in humid areas.
		
	Principle Of Working 
	
		As the name implies , it is suitable for places where the humidity is quite low and temperature quite high. 
		These conditions are in conformity with desert areas. Hence the coolers are called ‘Desert coolers’. 
		The principle on which a desert cooler works is ‘ Evaporative cooling’. Evaporative cooling is a process 
		in which sensible heat is removed and moisture added to the air. When air passes through a spray of water 
		it gives up heat to water, some of the water evaporated and picks up heat from the air equivalent to its 
		latent heat . The vapour thus formed are carried along in stream. In this way air is cooled and humidified.

	Contruction and working of a desert cooler 
	
		1	Blower/ Fan 
		2	Water circulating pump
		3	Water wetted pads
		4	Water tank
		5	Float valve 
	
		The water is filled in the sump of the cooler from water supply mains , the level of which is controlled 
		by a float valve. A water pump lifts the water and supplies it at the top of the cooler to the water 
		distribution system which consists of small branches of copper pipe or so equipped with orifices which 
		deliver equal amount of water to the troughs which in turns supply water to the wetted pads. The water 	
		which drops back from the pads is recirculated.  The pump may be made of brass , stainless steel or even 
		plastic. The blower pulls the air through the wetted pads and deliver it to space to be cooled through 
		an opening in the fourth side of the cabinet of desert cooler. The air which is sucked through the pads 
		is cooled by the principle of evaporative cooling .  The blower gives adequate velocity to the air 
		before it is delivered to the spaces to be cooled. 
			
		To have long life of the desert cooler and better performance , pads should be changed every year and 
		holes for water distribution system should be cleaned. The tank should be cleaned just after the season 
		and coated with corrosion resisting paint .

	Classification
	
		Fan in the vertical plane 
		
		<img src="exp2p1.jpg" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">	
		
			The arrangement of the components is shown in fig. there is a separate motor for the pump and fan 
			so they can be used independently. The arrangement of the components in a box providing 3 pads. 
			The pump , pumps the water from the bottom tank to the top and water trinkles through the holes 
			provided on the top of tank and falls passing the pads to the bottom tank. 

			Advantages of this type of cooler are:
			
				The pump cannot be started without starting the fan , which prevents unwanted running of pump.
				The system can be used as a cooler in hot summer and as a fan when cooling is not required. 

		Fan in horizontal plane
		
		<img src="exp2p2.jpg" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">	
		
			The wox type of the cooler falls under this class. The arrangement of the basic component is 
			shown in fig. this differs from the previous one in fan arrangement. The pump and fan are mounted 
			on same vertical shaft and run by a common motor. Hence the fan and pump cannot be operated 
			seperately as in the previous arrangement. 

			Advantages of this sytem are

				4 cooling pads instead of 3 , hence cooling capacity is more.
				Noise is less than other coolers.
				Unique omni directional air flow provides better air distribution in the room. 

		Cooler without water pump
		
		<img src="exp2p3.jpg" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">	
		
			The majority of the users in india are facing three major problems: 

				The coolers consume more electrical energy and hence not economical.
				The water pumps of the cooler are submerged in water tanks get damaged frequently .
				The khus pads need frequent replacement thereby causing inconveinence.
				
			To avoid such problems a new model known as ‘Quality desert cooler’ is developed.
			
			Advantages desert cooler
			
				Less expensive to install because estimated cost is half that of central refrigerated air conditioning
				Less expensive to operate because estimated cost of operation is ¼ that of refrigerated air
				Ease of maintanance because only two main parts fan &water pump which repair at low cost

Experiment : 3

Object : 

	To understand the construction principle of working , electrical circuit , dismounting , assembling , 
	possible faults , testing method of following electrical appliance i.e. electrical iron
	
		1  Non-automatic
		2  Automatic with wats
		
Constraction :

	Sole Plate
	
		The sole plate is the thick, triangular-shaped slab of iron that forms the base over which the electric 
		iron is built up. The bottom surface and edges are heavily chromium plated, to prevent it from rusting. 
		The base plate should hold the iron pressure plate and cover plate in position. For this purpose we can 
		see two or sometimes three studs in the base plate. These studs aid in holding the position of cover 
		plate and pressure plate.
		
	Pressure Plate
	
		This plate is generally called the top plate as it follows the shape of sole plate. The pressure plate 
		has some holes through which the studs form the base plate passes through. We should tighten the nuts on 
		the studs in such a way that the pressure plate and sole plate are pressed tight against each other. 
		In some iron the pressure plate is heavy and made of cast iron while in some other cases, it is a thin 
		sheet of steel, about ¼ cm thick.
		In automatic type of electric iron, the pressure plate has a rectangular or circular hole for locating the thermostat.

	The Heating Element

		The heating element is present between the sole plate and pressure plate. It is pressed hard between 
		the two plates. The heating element consists of nichrome wire wound around a sheet of mica. 
		The two ends of the nichrome wire are connected to the contact strips. The contact strips are connected 
		to the terminals of the iron. There are two reasons for which mica is chosen in the heating material. 
		Mica is a very good insulating material. Besides that mica can also withstand very high temperatures. 
		The entire assembly of mica sheet, nichrome wire and contact strips are riveted together resulting in 
		a mechanically sound and robust construction. There is an asbestos sheet, which separates and thermally 
		insulates the top plate from the heating element.
		
	The Cover Plate
	
		The cover plate is made of thin sheet of iron. It is placed on top of the base plate and it covers all 
		the internal parts of the iron. The handle and connector are only attached to the cover plate.

	Handle

		The handle can be made either with wood or with plastic. The handle is attached to the cover plate with 
		the aid of screws. Studs can also be used for this purpose.
		
	Pilot Lamp
	
		The pilot lamp is housed in the cover plate of the electric iron. One end of the pilot lamp is connected 
		to supply, while the other end is connected to the heating element. A shunt resistance is provided across 
		the pilot lamp which assists in providing a voltage drop. The shunt is designed to provide a 
		voltage drop of 2-5 volts.

	Thermostat

		When it comes to an automatic electric iron, the thermostat is the most important item. It uses a 
		bimetallic strip to operate the switch which is connected in series with the resistance (or) heating element.

		The bimetallic strip is a simple element which converts a temperature change into mechanical displacement. 
		A bimetallic strip consists of two different metals bonded together. The two metals should have a different 
		coefficient of expansion. If such a strip is heated, it starts to curve towards the metal having the lower 
		co-efficient of expansion. On cooling, it straightens and comes back to the normal position.

		Now we might wonder why such an element is used in iron. What is the purpose of this element in an electric iron?

		The bimetallic strip is attached to a contact spring through small pins. The contact point between the strip 
		and contact points remains closed. When the temperature rises significantly, the unusual expansion causes the 
		strip to curve and the contact between strip and contact spring opens. Thus the supply to heating element is 
		temporarily stopped (until the temperature goes down to normal). A special device called the cam is placed is 
		placed near the contact spring, with which we specify the amount of curving of bimetallic strip required to 
		separate the contact.

		Thus using bimetallic strip the temperature is kept constant within certain limits.

	Capacitor

		The thermostat helps in maintaining the temperature within limits. But frequent making and breaking of circuit 
		damages the contact points and it may also result in interference with radio reception. To avoid this, a 
		capacitor of certain range is connected across the two contact points.
		
	REPAIRING
	
		there are many problems that can come up with iron. The following are some of the common dry iron problems 
		along with their possible solutions.

		Dry Iron not heating enough

			PROBLEM: One of the most common troubles with dry irons is iron not heating enough.  
			  The possible causes for this could be wrong thermostat setting, problem with electric connections, 
			  problem with the power switch etc.

			SOLUTION: Thus to resolve this problem, you first need to check if you have made all the 
			  connections properly and in accordance with the user manual. Check the power switch, 
			  the plug and the thermostat as well. The thermostat is that element of an iron which helps 
			  control the temperature and the mode. If it is set at the wrong temperature, 
			  in particular a lower one, then the iron may not heat enough. 
			  So make sure you turn it to a reasonably higher setting.  
			  Moreover, try changing the heating mode to see whether the heat increases.
		
		Dry iron not working
		
			PROBLEM: Not heating enough and not working altogether are different issues. 
			  One common problem that people face is dry iron not working.

			SOLUTION: If your dry iron is not working at all then in that case you need to check the power 
			  cord first. If the cord is broken or damaged in any way, then this could be a cause of the 
			  appliance not working at all. Also try changing the plug into another power outlet to check 
			  whether the issue is with the outlet or the iron. Some other reasons why your dry iron may not 
			  be working could be wrong iron setting for example auto-off setting, limescale deposits on the 
			  soleplate and others.

		Dirty sole plate 

			PROBLEM: Any kind of iron can experience issues with the sole plate. Over a period of time and 
			  usage, a sole plate can get dirty and its holes can get clogged. This may affect its heating and 
			  overall performance.

			SOLUTION: It is thus important to clean and maintain the sole plate on a regular basis. For this, 
			  you must first remove any particles you see on the sole plate with your hand. After that, take 
			  a cloth, dampen it and put some salt on it.  Now rub this cloth on the bottom of the iron to 
			  remove stains and marks.   You can remove burn marks by directly sprinkling some oven cleaner 
			  and leave there for some time before washing with cold water.

		Iron sticking to clothes 

			PROBLEM: Another common dry iron problem that you may experience is iron sticking to the clothes 
			  or fabric. This could be due to a burnt soleplate. What happens is that due to constant usage, 
			 some fabric tends to stick an burn and this can lead to a burnt soleplate. This may result in the 
			  fabric getting stuck to the deposits.

			SOLUTION: In this case, make sure you clean your soleplate properly. You can do so first making 
			  a paste of 1 tablespoon water and 2 tablespoon baking soda. Apply this to the soleplate and use 
			  it for wiping the iron clean, cleaning steam holes
			  
	Precations at time of fixing
	
		1  The surface of base plate and weight plats should be well smoothed with file and sand paper.
		2  When asbestos sheet is used ,be careful to place it between the weight plate and the upper 
		   side of the element to avoid the dissipation of heat to upper side of element.
		3  There should be no gap between pressure plate and sole plate otherwise the element will be damaged very losses .
		4  Fitting should be tight enough.
    
	Precations at time of testing
	
		1  Do the in series of the supply and check also the supply before testing.
		2  At the time of DC supply unless you are sure that there is no defect in the iron.

	Result

		Iron is successfully studied.

Experiment : 4

Object : 
	
	To Study electric immersion heater.

Theory :	
	<img src="exp4p1.jpg" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">	
	Construction of electric immersion heater 
	
		The main parts are
	
			Heating element
			Outer frame Heating 
		
		Heating element 
			
			The heating element is made up of Nichrome wire which produces heat while giving electric supply. 
			Its melting point is about 4200 o C. The coil type heating element is normally used in this heater.
		
		Outer frame 
			
			The outer frame is made up of chromed iron brass pipe in which a heating element is placed. 
			Inside wall of the pipe is coated with magnesium oxide, which act as insulation, so that the 
			heating element may not touch the pipe. The top portion of the outer frame is made up of 
			bakelite  insulator. The ends of the heating element coils are connected at the points 
			called as a terminal which is connected to the power chord. The scale is also provided to 
			indicate the water lever to be maintained.

	Operation 
		
		To use immersion water heater, one simply fills a bucket of water and places the immersion rod into 
		the bucket either directly or with an aid like a clothes hanger. Then connect the plug into the socket 
		and switch ON. As the supply is given, the heating element gets heated and is transferred to the water. 
		So water gets heated.
		
		<img src="exp4p2.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">
		
	Testing of instrument immersion heater 
	
		Preface the series testing leads to test the water heater for open close shot and Earth for leakage 
		test by connecting the two end of testing lead to the terminal of plug top of the water heater if the 
		lamp does not give light .it makes these is an open circuit i.e breaking of electric wire inside the 
		body of water heater. if the left gives a bright light it mean those is short circuit i.e wire and at 
		the terminal of both wires in the cord leaking. if the lamp glow simly it mean the element of the water 
		it is a working order and it is known a closed circuit now to perform the test for earth fault connected 
		one end of the test lead to one terminal of plug and top and another to the  metal part of  body of the 
		water heater if the lamp glows it means the insulation inside the body is leaking from somewhere which 
		is known as a leakage fault.

	Precation 
	
		Without immersing the water heater in water, supply cannot be given.
		One should not touch the immersion rod when supply is ON.
		Before removing the immersion rod from water it should be disconnect from the plug socket.
		The water filled bucket should not be touched while the supply is ON.
		Except water no other liquid substance should be heated by immersion heater.

	Result

		These we have studied about the immersion water heater and also we have tested the water heater.

		and save the operator from severe socks.

	Testing
	
		By connecting the two ends of the testing leads to the two terminals of heater , if the lamp does 
		not glow it means there is an open circuit i.e.
		Breakage in the element or disconnecting of connecting wires or strips inside at the terminals are 
		touching together .ifthe lamp glows dimly , now to perform the earth testing when end of testing 
		leads to one terminal of the another wires of testing lead to the metal part of the heater.if the 
		lamp glows it means there is an Earth fault i.e. any part of the element
		or connecting wires or strip is touching the metal part of the heater . If there is parking on the
		body it means there is leakage i.e. insulating material is leaking The Other faults maybe in Cord 
		or in plug top or in the connection i.e. breakage or disconnection of wires ends.

	Heat converter
	
		This consists of capacitor start motor on parameter capacitor motor along with the blades ﬁtted on 
		the shaft of the motor which through air out of the converter heating element is also arranged in it 
		with the help of which is the air is heated and heat the room the heating element
		of motor is operated with operates switch and regulation it is used for cooling and heating the room. 
		The fan is arranged with tangential ﬂow system to throw equal share in all direction in the room to 
		warm it very soon . this is very useful because it serves two purposes i.e. cools the room and warms the room.

	Theory : Construction and working principle
		
		There may be of three main types of fan i.e
		
			1) DC table fans or ceiling fans
			2) AC table fan or ceiling fan
			3) AC/DC table fan or ceiling fan

		An electric fan is simply an electric motor , 
		fan rotating blades to throw the air
	
		DC fans are of DC series motor in which the rotating part armature is connected in series 
		with stationary part i.e field coils when the current is given show the motor the magnetic field is 
		set up in the field winding which experience a force in armature tending to move it at right angle
		to the field and the blades attached with the shaft of the armature displac the air.

		The same principle applies to the AC fans but these is some difference in 
		the construction of AC fans is called stator or armature .
		In the case of AC fans mainly two types of single phase motors .
		These all types of motor work on the principle of inductor type motor

		In case of AC / DC fan universal motor are used in which the wound armature and field 
		winding are connected in series which work on the principle of electric motor

		The speed fan are controlled by the speed of regulators.
		The regulators is wound with ewake wire and consists of a number of resistance in 
		steps and the fans works on the speed which we require.

Experiment : 8


Object : 

	To study the construction working principle of the hair Dryers

Apparatus required: 

	Hair Drier, 
	Test lamp (40 watt), 
	Screw driver, 
	Power supply (single phase, 230 volt, 50Hz A.C.) etc.
	
Theory :

	Function
	
		We are all very familiar with the daily routine; we wash our hair and then automatically pick up 
		the hairdryer, flip the switch and there is the hot air to dry quickly and let us get on with the day. 
		There are good reasons for people to dry their hair with a hairdryer, going out with wet hair 
		especially in the winter can be bad for our health, and lead to catching colds and chills. 
		A hair dryer also called blow dryer is an electrical device which can be used for styling and drying 
		the hair by speeding up the evaporation of water from the hair’s surface.

	<img src="exp8p1.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">

	Types of Hair Dryer
	
		1) Portable type hair dryer ii.
		2) Saloon (Bonnet) type hair dryer
		
		Both the hair dryers supply hot air to dry the wet hair on the common principle of blowers with a 
		heating element. A Bonnet type hair dryer model is shown in Figure 1

		
	Constructional parts of Hair Dryer
	
		A hair dryer needs only two parts to generate the blast of hot air that dries the hair
		
			1) simple motor-driven fan
			2) heating element
			
		But in addition to above parts, most basic models will have two switches, one to turn them on and off 
		and one to control the rate of airflow. Some models have an extra switch, called thermostat switch, 
		used to regulate the temperature of the airflow. 
		The exploded view of Bonnet type Hair dryer is shown in Figure 2

		<img src="exp8p2.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">

		Motor driven fan 
		
			The fan should probably be called a blower; the blade is shaped like the impeller on a vacuum 
			cleaner and mounted in a housing which is connected to the outlet duct. Most motors are of 
			single speed, shaded pole motors particularly in the smaller models. Some of the larger and more 
			elaborate types have multiple speed motors or solid state control units on Universal motor. 
			Early hair dryers put out only about 100 watts of heat. But nowadays hair dryers producing up 
			to about 2,000 watts are available, drying hair considerably faster. The motors will be designed 
			to work on 230 V, 1-phase, 50 Hz AC supply. The small black fan sits atop the motor as shown in 
			Fig 13.9. The motor spins the fan. Air is drawn in through the openings on the side of the hair dryer.

		Heating element
		
			The heating element in most hair dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that’s wrapped around 
			insulating mica boards as shown in Fig. 4 Nichrome wire is an alloy of two metals, nickel and 
			chromium. This alloy is used in heating elements in a number of household products, from curling 
			irons to toasters. Nichrome wire has two features that make it a good producer of heat

				1) It’s a poor conductor of electricity compared to something like copper wire. 
				   This gives the alloy enough resistance to get hot from all of the current flowing into it.
				2) It doesn’t oxidize when heated. Other metals like iron rust pretty quickly at the 
				   temperatures used in toasters and hair dryers.

			The heating element is of the open wire type, wound on thin mica insulating board. Something seen 
			more often these days are hair dryers with a ceramic coating on the heating element. Coming in a 
			variety of different configurations, ceramic-coated heating elements are said to heat more evenly and 
			effectively. It’s also popular to infuse the ceramic with materials such as crushed tourmaline, which 
			is said to support the creation of ions and ideal heat flow.. The majority of hair dryers seem to use 
			a three-section heating element (low, medium and high heating element) controlled by a selector switch.

		<img src="exp8p4.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">

	Thermostat Switch 
		
		Each heating element has special thermostat strip mounted near the air nozzle which senses the temperature 
		of the air flow. The thermostat switch is normally closed and is open if the hot air blown outside the heated 
		circuit becomes too hot. A fuse may be found
		connected in series between the temperature control switch and the heater element.
		Selector switch: As the majority of hair dryers seem to use a three-section heating element 
		(low, medium and high heating element) controlled by a selector switch, the switch will have 
		three positions – low, medium and high to select the heating element as per the requirement. 
		The selector switch will always be connected to the motor and then to the heater circuit so that the 
		heating element cannot be turned on unless the motor is running. The diagram showing electrical connection 
		of motor, selector switch and heating element are shown in Fig. 5.

	<img src="exp8p5.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">

	Working of Hair Dryer 
	
		The working of Hair dryer is much simpler and most of its mechanisms revolve around its fan. When the 
		dryer is switched on, the electricity moves to the windings of the motor of the fan. And here the 
		electrical energy is transformed to kinetic energy as it provides momentum to the fan. The motor and 
		the attached fan both spin. The centrifugal movement of the fan blades draws air in through the small 
		round air inlets in the side casing of the hair dryer. These holes are covered by a safety screen that 
		prevents other objects (such as strands of your hair) from being sucked in as well.
		The airflow thus generated by the fan is forced through the heating element by the shape of the hair 
		dryer casing. These coils are designed to get heated quickly using its electrical resistance and 
		electric current. When the air initially enters the barrel, it is much cooler than the nichrome wire, 
		so heat flows from the wire to the air, which becomes very hot. As the air is pushed along by the fan 
		and convection, it is replaced by cooler air and the cycle is repeated.The hot air streams out the end 
		of the barrel. The hot air thus emitted from a hair dryer increases the temperature of the air surrounding 
		each strand of hair. Since warm air can contain more moisture than air at room temperature, more water 
		can move from your hair into the air.

	Hair Dryer Safety
	
		The basic idea behind hair dryers is pretty simple, but producing one for mass consumption requires some 
		hard thinking about safety features. Here are some other safety features hair dryers commonly have

			1) Safety cut-off switch - Your scalp can be burned by temperatures more than 140 degrees 
			   Fahrenheit (approximately 60 degrees Celsius) To ensure that the air coming out of the barrel 
			   never nears this temperature, hair dryers have some type of heat sensor that trips the 
			   circuit and shuts off the motor when the temperature rises too much. This hair dryer and many 
			   others rely on a simple bimetallic strip as a cut-off switch. 
			   Fig.5 - Electrical wiring diagram of Hair dryer 
			2) Bimetallic strip - Made out of sheets of two metals, both expand when heated but at different 
			   rates. When the temperature rises inside the hair dryer, the strip heats up and bends because 
			   one metal sheet has grown larger than the other. When it reaches a certain point, it trips a 
			   switch that cuts off power to the hair dryer.
			3) Thermal fuse - For further protection against overheating and catching fire, there is often a 
			   thermal fuse included in the heating element circuit. This fuse will blow and break the circuit 
			   if the temperature and current are excessively high.
			4) Insulation - Without proper insulation, the outside of the hair dryer would become extremely hot 
			   to the touch. If you grabbed it by the barrel after using it, it might seriously burn your hand. 
			   To prevent this, hair dryers have a heat shield of insulating material that lines the plastic barrel.
			5) Protective screens - When air is drawn into the hair dryer as the fan blades turn, other things 
			   outside the hair dryer are also pulled toward the air intake. This is why you’ll find a wire screen 
			   covering the air holes on either side of the dryer. After you’ve used a hair dryer for a while, 
			   you’ll find a large amount of lint building up on the outside of the screen. If this were to build 
			   up inside the hair dryer, it would be scorched by the heating element or might even clog the motor 
			   itself. Even with this screen in place, you’ll need to periodically pick lint off the screen. 
			   Too much lint can block the airflow into the dryer, and the hair dryer will overheat with less 
			   air carrying away the heat generated by the nichrome coil or other type of heating element. 
			   Newer hair dryers have incorporated some technology from the clothes dryer: a removable lint screen 
			   that’s easier to clean.
			6) Front grill - The end of the barrel of a hair dryer is covered by a grill made out of material 
			   that can withstand the heat coming from the dryer. This screen makes it difficult for small 
			   children (or other especially inquisitive people) to stick their fingers or other objects down 
			   the barrel of the dryer, where they could be burned by contact with the heating element.

Precautions :

	1) Insulate yourself on the dry wood at the time of testing.
	2) Do the testing in series of the supply to avoid the risk of failure of supply.
	3) Never connect direct supply unless we are sure that there is no fault in the toaster to avoid the 
	   risk of failure of supply.

Rollno 	: 19UELE8030


Experiment : 9

Object :  
	
	To understand the construction and working principle, possible faults, testing methods of electric mixers and grinders.

Apparatus required : 
	
	Electric mixer (single phase-AC), 
	Screw driver, 
	Test lamp (40 W)
	
Theory :

	Mixer and Grinder is a kitchen appliances that facilitates task related with mixing and crushing the food. 
	These electric machines are very much helpful as they save time and energy. There are number of attachment like 
	blades, disc, jars etc. comes with these appliances to facilitate different uses to make the food more full 
	of flavour and yummy.

	Construction

		Motor
		
			The motor used in mixer is Universal motor, which is nothing but Series motor having both armature 
			and field. The special feature of this motor is that it can be operated both in AC and DC supply. 
			The armature core is made of silicon steel alloy and laminated to avoid eddy current and hysteresis losses. 
			This motor provides a very good torque and its speed is regulated either by tapped field coils or tapped 
			resistance in series. The power rating of motor would be about 500 W, operates on 220/204 V, 50 Hz AC supply. 
			The no load speed would be about 18000 rpm with a full load speed of about 10000 rpm. The motor is housed 
			in base of mixer body.

		Blender and Grinder 
		
			Normally each mixer is associated with 3 kinds of jar of different capacity.

		Blades 
		
			Blades are made of good quality stainless steel and will therefore give high life. Each jar will have 
			its own blades according to its purpose. Jars are designed to grind dry or wet substances. So it is 
			advisable not to interchange the blades from one jar to other.
		
		<img src="exp9p1.png" title="photo_part" alt="photo_part" height="60%">
		
		Speed control 

			For speed control purpose, the tapped field coils are normally employed in mixer motor. The tapped 
			field coils as shown in Fig.11.3, enables speed selection through a rotary switch provided in the mixer. 
			Normally 3 speed levels (1, 2 and 3) will be provided in the mixer motor. By turning rotary switch clockwise, 
			we can get speeds 1, 2 or 3 as desired mixer jars. For inching purpose, it is required to turn rotary 
			switch anti-clockwise for a few seconds and release for momentary operation. (This is especially useful 
			for wet grinding of chutneys, mincing meat, grating vegetables, crushing ice, etc.).

	Working:
	
		1) Place the rubber sealing ring on the base of the blade assemble. Screw the blender in the assemble until tight. 
		2) Place the ingredients in the blender. 
		3) Place the lid on the blender. When the motor is running, only the centre stopper should be removed to add water 
		   for the free circulation of materials. 
		4) Switch on the motor. 
		5) If a material sticks to the sides of the Jar, stop the mixer and stir using stirrer. Then run again. 
		6) When the operation is complete, Switch OFF the mixer. Wait for few seconds till the motor stops completely and 
		   then remove the blender.

Precautions :

	1) Do not run the motor without any load.
	2) The motor should not be run for more than the specified time (prescribed by the manufacturer)
	3) Do not operate unless Jar and Dome are in proper position.
	4) Do not grind hot ingredients in the mixer.
	5) Do not add solid ingredients, when the Motor is running.
	6) Do not add big ice pieces while making cold drinks. Crush the ice and put into the blender.
